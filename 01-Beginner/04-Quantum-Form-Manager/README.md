# Quantum Form State Manager

**Author**: Ashraf Morningstar  
**GitHub**: https://github.com/AshrafMorningstar

A demonstration of quantum superposition applied to form state management. Fields exist in probabilistic states until "observed" (validated).

## Features

- **Superposition States**: Fields are undetermined until validated
- **Quantum Entanglement**: Linking fields affects their probability waves
- **Wave Visualization**: Real-time rendering of the form's quantum coherence

## Usage

Typing in fields alters their local probability. Click "Entangle" to link input states, or "Observe" to collapse the wave function and trigger validation.
