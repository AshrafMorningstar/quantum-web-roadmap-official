# Holographic 3D CSS Playground

**Author**: Ashraf Morningstar  
**GitHub**: https://github.com/AshrafMorningstar

A cyberpunk-inspired tool that interprets flat CSS styles into 3D holographic projections.

## Features

- **WebGL Rendering**: Uses Three.js to render holograms
- **CSS-to-3D Parsing**: Interprets basic CSS properties (like `border-radius`) to change 3D geometry
- **Interference Controls**: Adjust flux density and hologram intensity

## Usage

Edit the CSS in the panel to change the shape and color of the hologram. Use the sliders to control the projection quality.
