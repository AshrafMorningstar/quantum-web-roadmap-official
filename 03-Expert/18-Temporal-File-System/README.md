# Temporal Versioning File System (TVFS)

**Author**: Ashraf Morningstar  
**GitHub**: https://github.com/AshrafMorningstar

A file system explorer that treats time as a native dimension.

## Concept

Traditional version control (like Git) requires manual commits. TVFS records every state change on a continuous timeline. This interface allows users to "scrub" through the lifespan of a file to recover any past state instantly.

## Usage

1. Select a file from the sidebar.
2. Use the "Temporal Version Control" slider at the bottom to travel back in time.
3. Observe the code content update in real-time to reflect the state of the file at that point in history.
