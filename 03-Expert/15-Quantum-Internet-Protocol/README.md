# Quantum Internet Protocol Stack

**Author**: Ashraf Morningstar

A visualization of the theoretical network stack for a Quantum Internet.

## Layers

1. **Physical**: Photon transmission over fiber optics.
2. **Link**: Generation of EPR pairs (entanglement) between nodes.
3. **Network**: Entanglement swapping to route connections across long distances/repeaters.
4. **Transport**: Quantum teleportation of qubit states using the established entanglement.
5. **Application**: The end-user quantum software logic.

## Usage

Click "Inject Qubit Packet" to watch data flow down the stack, being encapsulated, entangled, and finally transmitted as a photon wave in the physical layer.
