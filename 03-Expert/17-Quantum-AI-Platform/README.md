# Quantum AI Development Platform

**Author**: Ashraf Morningstar  
**GitHub**: https://github.com/AshrafMorningstar

A visualization interface for training Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs).

## Features

- **3D Neural Topology**: Visualizes qubits as nodes in a layered neural network.
- **Real-time Training Viz**: "Firing" synapses are highlighted as data flows through the quantum layers.
- **Training Simulation**: Mocks the loss convergence and accuracy metrics of a quantum machine learning model.

## Usage

Adjust hyperparameters in the sidebar and click "Initialize Training" to watch the quantum network propagate data and optimize its weights.
