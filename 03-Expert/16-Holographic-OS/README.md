A mock operating system environment using Glassmorphism and 3D transforms to simulate a holographic interface.

## Features

- **Spatial Parallax**: Windows tilt towards the user/mouse cursor to create depth.
- **Draggable Interface**: Fully functional window management.
- **Dynamic Spawning**: Launch new "Holographic Modules" from the dock.

## Usage

Drag windows around the screen. Move your mouse to observe the 3D perspective shift of the interface elements.
