# Distributed Quantum Computing Simulator

**Author**: Ashraf Morningstar  
**GitHub**: https://github.com/AshrafMorningstar

A drag-and-drop circuit composer for simulating 3-qubit quantum algorithms in the browser.

## Features

- **Visual Composer**: Drag quantum gates (Hadamard, Pauli-X, CNOT) onto qubit wires.
- **State Simulation**: Approximates the resulting measurement probabilities based on the circuit configuration.
- **Bloch Sphere Mockup**: Visualizes single qubit states (conceptually).

## Usage

1. Drag an 'H' gate to a wire to put a qubit in superposition.
2. Drag 'X' to flip a bit.
3. Click "Run Simulation" to see the probability distribution of measuring states 000 to 111.
