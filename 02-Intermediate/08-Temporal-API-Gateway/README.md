# Temporal API Gateway

**Author**: Ashraf Morningstar  
**GitHub**: https://github.com/AshrafMorningstar

An experimental API Gateway interface that introduces Time as a queryable dimension.

## Concept

Standard APIs return the _current_ state of a resource. The Temporal API Gateway allows clients to request the state of a resource at _any point in time_ - past (historical data) or future (predictive modeling based on quantum probability).

## Features

- **Temporal Parameters**: Specify target date/time for requests.
- **Probability Thresholds**: Determine confidence levels required for future predictions.
- **Causality Checks**: Simulates errors when requests violate temporal consistancy.
