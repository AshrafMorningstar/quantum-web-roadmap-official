# Quantum State Frontend Framework

**Author**: Ashraf Morningstar  
**GitHub**: https://github.com/AshrafMorningstar

A conceptual JavaScript framework where UI components exist in multiple potential states (superposition) until interacted with (observed).

## Core Concepts

- **QuantumState**: Manages multiple potential data values.
- **Wave Function Collapse**: Hovering or interacting with a component forces it to resolve to a single state.
- **Entanglement**: Multiple components bound to the same state update simultaneously when _any_ one of them is observed.

## Usage

Define a `QuantumState`, add possibilities, and bind it to a `QuantumComponent`. The UI will reflect the "Superposition" until the user observes it provided by `quantum-framework.js`.
