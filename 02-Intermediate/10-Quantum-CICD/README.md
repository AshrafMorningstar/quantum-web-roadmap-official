# Quantum CI/CD Pipeline

**Author**: Ashraf Morningstar  
**GitHub**: https://github.com/AshrafMorningstar

A continuous integration system that visualizes code testing across multiple "parallel universes" (runtime environments) simultaneously.

## Features

- **Multiverse Testing**: Runs build steps across 4 distinct tracks (Main, Edge Case, Legacy, Entropy).
- **Entropy Simulation**: One track is intentionally unstable ("Entropy") to simulate chaotic real-world conditions.
- **Real-time Status**: Visual indication of Running, Success, or Failure states.

## Usage

Click "Initiate Quantum Build" to trigger the parallel pipeline simulation. Watch as each track attempts to pass all 5 stages of deployment.
